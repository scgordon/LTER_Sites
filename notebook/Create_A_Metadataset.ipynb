    "# Data mining big metadata at DataONE: Creating a (meta)dataset\n",
    "###  Identifying and preparing EML records uploaded to DataONE by individual LTER sites, 2005-2018 for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook chronicles the research process in creating a dataset to look at the evolution of LTER metadata, as it was uploaded to DataONE. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a description of the hardware and software used in this research:\n",

    "During a 2016 investigation of LTER recommendation completeness through time, it was discovered that records from a later year were no more likely to be complete than those of an earlier year. This result came from a dataset that was a random sample of LTER. \n",

    "\n",
    "The data on the investigation into the LTER DataONE Member node's useage of the LTER Recommendation seemed to indicate that either there was not an organization knowledge of how to use recommendation or the recommendation was followed to varying degrees by individuals. Upon learning that LTER was actually comprised of several sites with varying start dates and technical knowledge, I decided to investigate if the DataONE metadata catalog for LTER could be reliably broken up by site and by year to see how the community evolved the useage of the recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned from the EDI that the packageid element and DataONE identifier convention included the three letter site abbreviation. With this information I began to dig into DataONE's central node to see if I could build a dataset that could allow me to investigate each site over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the data mining and analysis used to decide which records would make a dataset that could be used to investigate the knowledge and understanding of the LTER Recommendation for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the records are identified they are downloaded to directories following the convention \"Site__Year\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This precise dataset building is neccessary to get a clear view as we expect to see that different sites have different rates of improvement from different starting points. Additionally, even though they are all a part of LTER, they have different information needs and are likely to use slightly different metadata .\n",
    "\n",
    " To do this we'll need a list of all the sites and some metadata about records from DataONE's Solr index to see if it's possible to use part of the record name or idenifier to create collections of records for each site.\n",

We make an assumption based on observing obsoleted chains in the Solr metadata about the identifier. We create a baseID which we define as the part of the identifier string before the last period and attach it to a year so that when a record is updated the previous version gets an \"obsoletedBy\" field in the SolrResponses. If a record is obsoleted by another record, there will be a \"Yes\" in the Obsoleted Column.

Additionally very few records are obsoleted after 2015, and none of the records that were obsoleted before 2015. Including records after the pasta system came online would introduce a lot of noise into the metadataset, and it looks like records that were previously added to DataONE and obsoleted are reintroduced as active records so in 2015-2018 we have records being duplicated and unobsoleted, exposing reliability issues for the discoverability of datasets the DataONE repository holds.\n",
